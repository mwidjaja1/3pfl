## 1. Don't intentionally hurt the team ‚ù§Ô∏è

We expect all teammates to play, speak, and behave in a way so that our team is better with you than without. All teammates are expected to follow these rules, with these examples being non-exhaustive of the range of conditions we're considering:

- **Respect your teammates, even if the other side was at fault**. For example, do not bully, harass, lie, grief, discriminate, insult, or be rude to a teammate.
- **Contribute in a family friendly way that benefits the team**. For example, do not abuse your team role, use vulgar or crude language, or spam.
- **Don't sabotage the team during games**. For example, do not troll, grief, or sandbag your fellow teammates during a game. If players agreed to tie, do not break that agreement.
- **Don't break any laws or Noodlecake's Terms of Service**

When a rule violation is identified:

- **If this is an emergency situation** where action must be taken immediately to protect the team or a player, any captain or co-captain can take action immediately. Some examples include illegal activity, actual threats to one's safety, attempting to destroy the team, etc.
- **In all other cases,** the captains will privately discuss this matter. They will decide if a warning, demotion, and/or booting is appropriate based on the severity & confidence of the issue at hand. A verdict can be reached once 3 co-captains/captains explicitly agrees, so long as there isn't more co-captains/captains explicitly disagreeing.

If you want to report a team member for violating these rules, try to take evidence if possible and let us know by [DM'ing a captain on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or by submitting a report on our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl). 

 ## 2. Promotions Guidelines üìà
Once a week (on a randomly selected day) we will promote eligible players by +1 Tier. The promotion guidelines are as follows:

- **For Rookies to become Amateur:**
    - Players must be on the team for the past 7d and currently have at least 1700 trophies.
    - Players must be free from any rule violations for at least the past 14d.
    - Players must have contributed to the team in some way for the past 7d (i.e. trading cards, chatting, positive team engagement, etc).
- **For Amateurs to become Pro**:
    - The same requirements as the Amateur tier plus...
    - Players must be on the 3PFL Discord or actively engaged in the game chat.
- **For Pros to become Co-Captain**: These are done rarely, on an invite basis for players who've made exceptional contributions to the team.

#### Gifts for Pro: Free Sticker and/or Iron On Patch üíå
Players who became Pro for the first time are eligible to request a free sticker and/or iron-on patch of our team logo mailed out. Fill out [the form at our homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl) to request one. This is our gift to say thank you for being on our team.

If you request an Iron On Patch, [follow these instructions to apply it](https://d3ccuprjuqkp1j.cloudfront.net/SupportImages/PDFinstructions/Iron-On_Instructions_2021.pdf?utm_source=offline&utm_medium=productinstructions&utm_campaign=instructionsheet2022). You'll have to BYO Parchment or Wax Paper in Step 3.

## 3. Demotion + Boot Guidelines üòû
Players may be demoted for these reasons:

- **Being inactive during the past 7d:** These players will be demoted by -1 tier on Promotion/Demotion Day.
- **Being effectively silent over consecutive weeks:** If a player is no longer contributing to the team (i.e card pool, chatting, positive team engagement, etc) over _consecutive_ weeks, that _may_ count as being inactive too.
- **Violating a rule:** These players may be demoted by any number of tiers at any point in time, though we do prefer to warn players first whenever possible.

If a 'Rookie' player had a reason to be demoted again, they become a candidate for booting at the next need for an available seat. We will always try to warn booted players on Discord whenever possible. We boot players according to these factors:

- We do not want more than one open seat at any given time.
  - Captains may use alt players to fill extra seats, as a mechanism to keep our trophy count high enough, until we can go back to a max of one open seat. When this happens, a captain must notify the team what player that is.
- We prioritize inviting prior team members back, who didn't leave due to negative behaviors, when they're within range of our current trophy minimum.

## 4. You are encouraged to tie and/or help your teammates in game ü§ù
When you're playing against a teammate, especially during Challenge Games, both players are encouraged to tie and/or help each other out. To propose to tie, one player must spam the 'Nooo' emoji three times. The other player must respond with the 'Nooo' emoji three times _or_ with a üëç. If they don't respond this way, this rule is **not** active, it's game on, and this is allowable, though consistent behavior of not tying could impact your promotion status in the future.

It is against the rules for:

1. Both players to agree to help and for one player to use that opportunity to backstab the other player into an easy win.
2. For one player to explicitly taunt or grief a teammate in a 1v1 game.

When this happens, please provide video evidence if you can and report it to @iwidji [on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or via our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl).

## 5. Don't give us a reason to change the rules because of you üå≠
If you're testing the Team Rules to see how far you can go, brace yourself for disappointment just like meeting a fellow person who believes the hotdog is a sandwich. These rules can change at anytime with no warning to protect a friendly & active team environment.

# Questions? Feedback? üí¨
You are always welcome and encouraged to chat with a captain or co-captain if you have questions or feedback. You can do that [on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or via our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl)
