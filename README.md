## 1. Be friendly to our team ‚ù§Ô∏è

We are trying to create a friendly + active team environment. To that end, all teammates -- regardless of level even up to Captain -- are expected to:

- **Be respectful to all teammates even if the other side was at fault**. Violations include bullying, harassment, lying, griefing, vulgarity, or rudeness toward teammates.
- **Support our family friendly community**. Violations include abusing your role, making discriminatory statements, being egregiously not family friendly, or spam.
- **Not break any laws or Noodlecake's Terms of Service**

When a rule violation is identified:

- **Emergency situations:** Any captain/co-captain can act immediately.
- **All other cases:** Captains will discuss privately and decide on either a warning/demotion/boot once 3 captains agree (unless more disagree).

**To report violations:** Take evidence and DM a captain on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or use our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl).

 ## 2. Promotions Guidelines üìà

Promotions happen around season end for players who meet ALL requirements:

- **No Rule Violations:** Clean record for past two seasons
- **Active in Game:** Logged in within past 7 days
- **Engaged with the Team:** Rookies must meet 1 of these rules, Amateurs must meet 2, and Pros must meet 3
  - Traded Cards
  - Actively Engages with the Chat
  - Has +1700 Trophies
  - Being on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv).

Co-Captain promotions are done rarely, on an invite basis for players who've made exceptional contributions to the team.

## 3. Demotion + Boot Guidelines üòû
We typically demote players during promotion day based on these rules:

- **Automatic demotion:** Not logging in for 7+ days (can happen anytime for each 7d window)
- **Possible demotion:** Not meeting engagement requirements for consecutive seasons
- **Demotion/boot:** Rule violations (can happen anytime)

**Booting process:**
- Rookies facing second demotion become candidates for booting.
- We try to only have 1 open seat at a time. Captains may use alts temporarily to fill a vacancy to get to that max vacancy, so long as they announce it to the team.
- When filling a vacancy, we prefer inviting prior teammates back so long as they're within 200 trophies from our current minimum.

## 4. Stickers and/or Iron-On Patches for Pros üíå
Pros get a free sticker/iron-on patch via our [homepage form](https://linktr.ee/3pfl). This is our way of saying thanks for joining the team! [These are the instructions for applying the Iron On Patch]](https://d3ccuprjuqkp1j.cloudfront.net/SupportImages/PDFinstructions/Iron-On_Instructions_2021.pdf?utm_source=offline&utm_medium=productinstructions&utm_campaign=instructionsheet2022).

## 5. You're strongly encouraged to tie in Challenge Games and/or acknowledge your teammates in Trophy Games ü§ù
You're strongly encouraged to tie with your teammates in Challenge Games and acknowledge your teammates in Trophy Games. Here's how:

1. One player must initiate by spamming NOO x3
2. If the other player spams NOO x3 or sends a üëç, both players must tie.
3. If the other player does NOT respond with NOO x3 or a üëç, both players should play normally. This is allowed, just don't bully your teammate unnecessarily.

It is against the rules for:

1. Backstabbing a player after an agreement
2. Taunting or griefing a teammate in a 1v1 game, even if they didn't agree to tie/acknowledge.

When this happens, please provide video evidence if you can and report it to @iwidji [on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or via our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl).

## 6. Don't give us a reason to change the rules because of you üå≠
If you're testing the Team Rules to see how far you can go, brace yourself for disappointment just like meeting a fellow person who believes the hotdog is a sandwich. These rules can change at anytime with no warning to protect a friendly & active team environment.
