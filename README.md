# 3 Putt for Life Team Rules

## Summary
We expect all team members to follow these four rules on the game and [on our Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv).
1. Be friendly and respectful to our team. Bullying, harassing, lying, promotion of off topic ventures (i.e. spam), and abusing your role are examples of not being respectful. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2. We promote players who were on the team during the last 7 days, were active, has 1700+ trophies, & is on Discord membership (for Pro promotions) üìà
3. We demote/boot players who are inactive in the last 7 days or violated a rule üòû
4. Team members who get promoted to pro are eligible for a free 3PFL Sticker üíå
5. If you want to tie with another player, spam NOO x3. If the other player responds the same or responds with a üëç, it means you agree to help each other.
6. Don't give us a reason to change the rules because of you

---

## 1. Be friendly to our team ‚ù§Ô∏è

- You will be demoted or booted if 3+ active captains determined that you attacked another teammate. This includes bullying, harassment, cursing, misleading, or rudeness towards another teammate, _even if the other side was at fault too_.
- You will be asked to stop if 3+ active captains determined you did something that wasn't appropriate or beneficial for our community. This includes abusing your team role, disobeying a captain, promotion of off topic ventures (i.e. spam), or doing something which was illegal, NSFW, or discriminatory. We are more strict on the in-game chat, to comply with Noodlecake's TOS. If you continue after we asked you to stop, you will be demoted or booted.

You can report any issues by [DM'ing a captain on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or by submitting a report on our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl). 

 ## 2. Promotions Guidelines üìà
Once a week (on a randomly selected day) we will promote eligible players by +1 Tier. Promotions are done to encourage activity & appropriate behaviors. Players are eligible for promotion if they fulfill ALL of these:

- Was on the team and active during the past 7 days.
- Met the current trophy min or is above 1700, whichever is lower.
- Did not recently violate Rule #1.
- To go from Amateur to Pro: Must be on the 3PFL Discord. (p.s. once you're a Pro, you can request a free physical team sticker.)
- To go from Pro to Co-Captains: These are done rarely, on an invite basis for players who've made exceptional contributions to the team.

## 3. Demotion + Boot Guidelines üòû
Players may receive a -1 tier demotion during Promotion Day if they didn't play _or_ wasn't active during the past 7 days. Players may be demoted or booted out of turn if they violated Rule #1.

If a 'Rookie' player had a reason to be demoted again, they become a candidate for booting at the next need for an available seat. We will always try to warn booted players on Discord whenever possible. We boot players according to these factors:

- We do not want more than one open seat at any given time.
  - Captains may use alt players to fill extra seats, as a mechanism to keep our trophy count high enough, until we can go back to a max of one open seat. When this happens, a captain must notify the team what player that is.
- When a seat opens, captains should start with a higher trophy minimum and slowly lower it the longer the seat remains unfilled.
- We prioritize inviting prior team members back, who didn't leave due to negative behaviors, so long as their trophy count is within -200 trophies of what the current trophy minimum is.

## 4. Stickers and/or Iron-On Patches for Pros üíå
Players who became Pro for the first time are eligible to request a free sticker and/or iron-on patch of our team logo mailed out. Fill out [the form at our homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl) to request one. This is our gift to say thank you for being on our team.

If you request an Iron On Patch, [follow these instructions to apply it](https://d3ccuprjuqkp1j.cloudfront.net/SupportImages/PDFinstructions/Iron-On_Instructions_2021.pdf?utm_source=offline&utm_medium=productinstructions&utm_campaign=instructionsheet2022). You'll have to BYO Parchment or Wax Paper in Step 3.

## 5. In a Trophy game where all players are teammates, try to tie ü§ù
In a 2 player trophy game, both players may opt to throw the match so nobody loses trophies. To propose doing this, one player must spam the 'Nooo' emoji three times. The other player must respond with the 'Nooo' emoji three times _or_ with a üëç. If they don't respond this way, this rule is **not** active and it's game on. It is against the rules for both players to agree to help and for one player to use that opportunity to backstab the other player into an easy win. When this happens, please provide video evidence as soon as you can and report it to @iwidji [on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or via our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl)

## 6. Don't give us a reason to change the rules because of you üå≠
If you're testing the Team Rules to see how far you can go, brace yourself for disappointment just like meeting a fellow person who believes the hotdog is a sandwich. These rules can change at anytime with no warning to protect a friendly & active team environment.
