# 3 Putt for Life Team Rules

## Summary
We expect all team members to follow these four rules on the game and [on our Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv).
1. Be friendly and respectful to our team. Bullying, harassing, lying, abusing your role, and spamming are examples of not being respectful. ❤️
2. We promote players who are active on the team, has 1700+ trophies, & is positively contributing to the team 📈
3. We demote/boot players who are inactive in the last 7 days, consistently didn't meet their role's guidelines, or violated a rule 😞
4. Team members who get promoted to pro are eligible for a free 3PFL Sticker 💌
5. If you want to tie with another player, spam NOO x3. If the other player responds the same or responds with a 👍, it means you agree to help each other.
6. Don't give us a reason to change the rules because of you

---

## 1. Be friendly to our team ❤️

We are trying to create a friendly + active team environment. To that end, all teammates -- regardless of level even up to Captain -- are expected to:

- **Be respectful to all teammates even if the other side was at fault**. Some examples of violations include bullying, harassment, lying, griefing, vulgarity, or rudeness that's targeted to a teammate.
- **Support our family friendly community**. Some examples of violations include abusing your team role, making discriminatory statements, being egregiously not family friendly, or egregious spam.
- **Not break any laws or Noodlecake's Terms of Service**

When a rule violation is identified:

- **If this is an emergency situation** where action must be taken immediately to protect the team or a player, any captain or co-captain can take action immediately. Some examples include illegal activity, actual threats to one's safety, attempting to destroy the team, etc.
- **In all other cases,** the captains will privately discuss this matter. They will decide if a warning, demotion, and/or booting is appropriate based on the severity & confidence of the issue at hand. A verdict can be reached once 3 co-captains/captains explicitly agrees, so long as there isn't more co-captains/captains explicitly disagreeing.

If you want to report a team member for violating these rules, try to take evidence if possible and let us know by [DM'ing a captain on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or by submitting a report on our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl). 

 ## 2. Promotions Guidelines 📈
Once a week (on a randomly selected day) we will promote eligible players by +1 Tier in this way:

**All Promotions follow these guidelines**:
- You must be on the team and active for the past 7 days
- You must meet the current trophy minimum or have above 1700 trophies, whichever is lower.
- Did not recently violate a team rule.

**Additionally, these roles have special requirements**:
- **To become an Amateur**: You must be a good team mate. Examples include trading cards, chatting with the team, and/or having positive experiences with the team in game.
- **To become a Pro**: You must be an engaged team mate. Examples include being active on team chat or being a member of the 3PFL Discord. Plus, everything above.
- **To become a Co-Captain**: These are done rarely, on an invite basis for players who've made exceptional contributions to the team. Plus, everything above.

## 3. Demotion + Boot Guidelines 😞

On promotion day, we will also unfortunately demote eligible players by -1 tier in this way:

**All Demotions follow these guidelines:**
- Players _will_ be demoted on Promotion/Demotion day if they weren't active during the past 7 days.
- Players _may_ be demoted at anytime if they violated any of our Team Rules.
- Players _may_ be demoted on Promotion/Demotion day if they have not met their role's special requirements over consecutive seasons.

If a 'Rookie' level player had a reason to be demoted again, they become a candidate for booting at the next need for an available seat. We will boot players with a focus of keeping the team stable in regards to both the leaderboard rankings and team culture.

## 4. Stickers and/or Iron-On Patches for Pros 💌
Players who became Pro for the first time are eligible to request a free sticker and/or iron-on patch of our team logo mailed out. Fill out [the form at our homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl) to request one. This is our gift to say thank you for being on our team.

If you request an Iron On Patch, [follow these instructions to apply it](https://d3ccuprjuqkp1j.cloudfront.net/SupportImages/PDFinstructions/Iron-On_Instructions_2021.pdf?utm_source=offline&utm_medium=productinstructions&utm_campaign=instructionsheet2022). You'll have to BYO Parchment or Wax Paper in Step 3.

## 5. In a Trophy game where all players are teammates, try to tie 🤝
In a game where multiple teammates are playing, teammates can agree to tie and/or help each other out.

- To propose doing this, one player must spam the 'Nooo' emoji three times.
- The other teammate(s) must respond with the 'Nooo' emoji three times _or_ with a 👍.
- If all teammates don't respond this way, this rule is **not** active, it's game on, and this is allowable.

It is against the rules for:

1. Both players to agree to help and for one player to use that opportunity to backstab the other player into an easy win.
2. For one player to explicitly taunt or grief a teammate in a 1v1 game.

When this happens, please provide video evidence if you can and report it to @iwidji [on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or via our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl).

## 6. Don't give us a reason to change the rules because of you 🌭
If you're testing the Team Rules to see how far you can go, brace yourself for disappointment just like meeting a fellow person who believes the hotdog is a sandwich. These rules can change at anytime with no warning to protect a friendly & active team environment.
