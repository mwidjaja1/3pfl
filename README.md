## 1. Don't intentionally hurt the team ‚ù§Ô∏è

We expect all teammates to play, speak, and behave in a way so that our team is better with you than without. All teammates are expected to follow these rules, with these examples being non-exhaustive of the range of conditions we're considering:

- **Respect your teammates, even if the other side was at fault**. For example, do not bully, harass, lie, grief, discriminate, insult, or be rude to a teammate.
- **Contribute in a family friendly way that benefits the team**. For example, do not abuse your team role, use vulgar or crude language, or spam.
- **Tie in challenge mode and don't sabotage the team in trophy games**. For example, do not troll, grief, or sandbag the team in trophy games.
- **Not break any laws or Noodlecake's Terms of Service**

When a rule violation is identified:

- **If this is an emergency situation** where action must be taken immediately to protect the team or a player, any captain or co-captain can take action immediately. Some examples include illegal activity, actual threats to one's safety, attempting to destroy the team, etc.
- **In all other cases,** the captains will privately discuss this matter. They will decide if a warning, demotion, and/or booting is appropriate based on the severity & confidence of the issue at hand. A verdict can be reached once 3 co-captains/captains explicitly agrees, so long as there isn't more co-captains/captains explicitly disagreeing.

If you want to report a team member for violating these rules, try to take evidence if possible and let us know by [DM'ing a captain on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or by submitting a report on our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl). 

 ## 2. Promotions Guidelines üìà
Once a week (on a randomly selected day) we will promote eligible players by +1 Tier. Promotions are done to encourage activity & appropriate behaviors. Players are eligible for promotion if they fulfill ALL of these:

- Was active on the team during the past week.
- Met the current trophy min or is above 1700, whichever is lower.
- Did not violate Rule #1 in the past two seasons.
- To go from Amateur to Pro: Must be on the 3PFL Discord or actively engaged in the game chat. (p.s. once you're a Pro, you can request a free physical sticker of our team logo.)
- To go from Pro to Co-Captains: These are done rarely, on an invite basis for players who've made exceptional contributions to the team.

## 3. Demotion + Boot Guidelines üòû
Players may receive a -1 tier demotion during Promotion Day if they weren't active during the past 7 days. Players may be demoted or booted at any time if they violated Rule #1.

If a 'Rookie' player had a reason to be demoted again, they become a candidate for booting at the next need for an available seat. We will always try to warn booted players on Discord whenever possible. We boot players according to these factors:

- We do not want more than one open seat at any given time.
  - Captains may use alt players to fill extra seats, as a mechanism to keep our trophy count high enough, until we can go back to a max of one open seat. When this happens, a captain must notify the team what player that is.
- We prioritize inviting prior team members back, who didn't leave due to negative behaviors, when they're within range of our current trophy minimum.

## 4. Stickers and/or Iron-On Patches for Pros üíå
Players who became Pro for the first time are eligible to request a free sticker and/or iron-on patch of our team logo mailed out. Fill out [the form at our homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl) to request one. This is our gift to say thank you for being on our team.

If you request an Iron On Patch, [follow these instructions to apply it](https://d3ccuprjuqkp1j.cloudfront.net/SupportImages/PDFinstructions/Iron-On_Instructions_2021.pdf?utm_source=offline&utm_medium=productinstructions&utm_campaign=instructionsheet2022). You'll have to BYO Parchment or Wax Paper in Step 3.

## 5. Don't give us a reason to change the rules because of you üå≠
If you're testing the Team Rules to see how far you can go, brace yourself for disappointment just like meeting a fellow person who believes the hotdog is a sandwich. These rules can change at anytime with no warning to protect a friendly & active team environment.

# Questions? Feedback? üí¨
You are always welcome and encouraged to chat with a captain or co-captain if you have questions or feedback. You can do that [on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or via our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl)
