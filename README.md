## 1. Be friendly to our team ‚ù§Ô∏è

We are trying to create a friendly + active team environment. To that end, all teammates -- regardless of level even up to Captain -- are expected to:

- **Be respectful to all teammates even if the other side was at fault**. Some examples of violations include bullying, harassment, lying, griefing, vulgarity, or rudeness that's targeted to a teammate.
- **Support our family friendly community**. Some examples of violations include abusing your team role, making discriminatory statements, being egregiously not family friendly, or egregious spam.
- **Honor the spirit of the rules**
- **Not break any laws or Noodlecake's Terms of Service**

When a rule violation is identified:

- **If this is an emergency situation** where action must be taken immediately to protect the team or a player, any captain or co-captain can take action immediately.
- **In all other cases,** the captains will privately discuss this matter. They will decide if a warning, demotion, and/or booting is appropriate based on the severity & confidence of the issue at hand. A verdict can be reached once 3 co-captains/captains explicitly agrees, so long as there isn't more co-captains/captains explicitly disagreeing.

If you want to report a team member for violating these rules, try to take evidence if possible and let us know by [DM'ing a captain on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or by submitting a report on our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl). 

 ## 2. Promotions Guidelines üìà
Once a week (on a randomly selected day) we will promote eligible players by +1 Tier who meet all of the criteria below:

- You must logged into the game and be part of our the team for the past 7 days.
- You must have been active, using your role's definition of active, during the past 7 days.
  - For Amateur: Trading cards and/or having some form of a positive interaction with the team.
  - For Pro: Being active on team chat and/or being a member of the 3PFL Discord.
- You must meet the current trophy minimum or have above 1700 trophies, whichever is currently lower.
- Did not violate a team rule in the past 2 seasons.

Promotions to Co-Captain are done rarely, on an invite basis for players who've made exceptional contributions to the team.

## 3. Demotion + Boot Guidelines üòû

On promotion day, we will also unfortunately demote eligible players by -1 tier in this way:

- Players _will_ be demoted on Promotion/Demotion day if they haven't logged into the game over the past 7 days.
- Players _may_ be demoted at anytime if they violated any of our Team Rules.
- Players _may_ be demoted on Promotion/Demotion day if they have not met their role's definition of being active over consecutive seasons.

If a 'Rookie' level player had a reason to be demoted again, they become a candidate for booting at the next need for an available seat. We will boot players with a focus of keeping the team stable in regards to both the leaderboard rankings and team culture.

## 4. In a Trophy game where all players are teammates, try to tie ü§ù
In a game where multiple teammates are playing, teammates can agree to tie and/or help each other out.

- To propose doing this, one player must spam the 'Nooo' emoji three times.
- The other teammate(s) must respond with the 'Nooo' emoji three times _or_ with a üëç.
- If all teammates don't respond this way, this rule is **not** active, it's game on, and this is allowable.

**It is against the rules for:**
1. Both players to agree to help and for one player to use that opportunity to backstab the other player into an easy win.
2. For one player to explicitly taunt or grief a teammate in a 1v1 game.

When this happens, please provide video evidence if you can and report it to @iwidji [on Discord](https://discord.gg/RGzcnXfWhv) or via our [Homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl).

## 5. Stickers and/or Iron-On Patches for Pros üíå
Players who became Pro for the first time are eligible to request a free sticker and/or iron-on patch of our team logo mailed out. Fill out [the form at our homepage](https://linktr.ee/3pfl) to request one. This is our gift to say thank you for being on our team.
